		<div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
			<p>A reasonably long time ago, in a state a considerably long drive away, there were two computer scientists and a computer science associate residing in the kingdom known as UMD (pronounced "uhmduh"). In a quest to slay the dragon named "Swag" and consume free food prepared by the gracious southerners, they embarked on a long and treacherous bus ride for fourteen long months in order to-- wait, what's that? It was a fourteen HOUR journey? And it wasn't really that treacherous?</p>
			<p>Understood.</p>
			<p>They traveled on this maddeningly soporofic journey in order to meet their PHP guide from Texas State University. On their hunt for Swag, they would soon become intoxicated with a desire to attain a ring, one which had the power of NFC. However, despite their immense lust for the ring, they would soon discover that the journey would require a sacrifice of precious mental resources, and would direct their efforts instead to a new ambition to create an application of unfathomable practicality.</p>
			<p>Along their route, they would stumble on to a computer wizard named Rex the Wise, who saw the greatness in the group and awarded them with armor made of lava-forged metals stitched into the finest "Meshery" pattern. He told them that whenever they should need it, a spell would appear on the meshery armor to help them defeat the other hackers, slay Swag, and steal the basis, a rare treasure hoarded by the dragon.</p>
			<p>This is more than a website. This is more than a product review application. It is the epic conclusion to a wonderful story about four courageous hobb-- people who overcame their fear of hacking a thon and found the error in their code.</p>
